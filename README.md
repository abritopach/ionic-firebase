# IonicFirebse

Sample project that shows a fullstack application where we will be building an events manager application in Ionic that uses Firebase.

This project is an example created by [Jorge Vergara](https://javebratt.com/) that have been modified by me. This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack shown above.

Technologies: Angular, Ionic, Firebase, Capacitor, TypeScript.

This project shows you how to:

    * Use Firebase & Firestore.
    * Angular Route Guards.
    * Interacting with a User Profile.
    * Working with Collections.
    * Working with Transactions.
    * Camera API & Firebase Storage.
    * CRUD events.
    * Added guest to event.

## Running

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of Ionic concepts. You must also already have Ionic installed on your machine.

* Test in localhost:

To run it, cd into `ionic-firebase` and run:

```bash
npm install
